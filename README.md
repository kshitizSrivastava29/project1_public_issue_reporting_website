# project1_public_issue_reporting_website
This is my First project which I had made using ai (for backend ) as I was just a beginner .
<br>
This platform enables citizens to report public issues—such as potholes, broken streetlights, sanitation problems, or other civic concerns—directly through a user-friendly website. Each report can include descriptions, images, and location details to help authorities identify and address the problem efficiently.  A key feature of the system is <b>live status tracking </b>: once an issue is submitted, users can view its progress in real time—submitted ,acknowledged, in-progress, and resolved.

<br>Admin dashboard website code is visible though it will not run on github but it will run on browser if admin.html and index.html are in same folder
